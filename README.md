- 👋 Hi, I’m Matias Rasmussen
- 🌱 I’m currently studying electronical engineering. As a part of the education I got introduced to coding - and got HOOKED.
- 👀 I’m interested in LEARNING. Since I'm not in the data branch, what I've learned until now is pretty basic. 
      Through playing around and knowledge of math and physics, I've created some pretty - though simple - satisfying projects in P5.js and some C++. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with someones with passion and patiens to teach a fearly fastlearning, passioned and "self taught" creator.
- 📫 How to reach me:
